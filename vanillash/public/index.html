<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I am a software developer from Innsbruck, Austria.</p>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>I consider myself an <em>engineer</em> at heart. That generally means a lot of tinkering. Over the years I&rsquo;ve played around with several dozen different programming language, frameworks, and libraries. I learned the basics, maybe built a small project with it, and then moved on. The problem with this approach is that you never really learn the intricacies of each tool fully, and spend a lot of time re-learning the same concepts with different accents. Recently, I&rsquo;ve resolved myself to use a smaller toolkit.</p>

  <p class="feature-content">As a huge fan of rapid prototyping and building clean and useful UIs for my applications, I&rsquo;ve recently fallen in love with Flutter for building cross-platform frontend apps. In the future, I hope to pivot most of my frontend- and full-stack development to Dart and Flutter.</p>

  <h3 class="feature-title">Java</h3>
  <hr class="separator" />
  <p class="feature-content">Let&rsquo;s be real: Java is probably not a favourite among coders. However, as I have a lot of exposition to Java EE for backend development in my current position, Spring is a natural fit for quickly bootstrapping APIs, and Java-based servers can generally be deployed relatively painlessly.</p>

  <h3 class="feature-title">Python</h3>
  <hr class="separator" />
  <p class="feature-content">I used Python excessively during my university days, especially during my master&rsquo;s programme, which was heavily focused on machine learning and data science. While I&rsquo;ve since sworn off using Python for other use-cases like web-apps (Django ♥), I still use it for data analysis and machine learning projects.</p>

  <p class="feature-content">Although C# holds a special place in my heart for being the first programming language I learned, I tend not to come in contact with it very frequently. However, C-based languages are used in various places of interest, such as game development and microcontrollers.</p>

<p>Despite focusing on these languages, the world of software development is vast, and I won&rsquo;t always be able to resist the temptation to tinker with a new toy. For example, the website you&rsquo;re on right now was originally scaffolded using Bootstrap Studio using pure HTML and CSS, then converted into a Hugo template. Did I know what Hugo was before I built it? No, but after seeing that Squarespace charges 11€/month and doesn&rsquo;t even offer the option to change your template for all pages of a blog, I figured this was the better investment.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, I purchased the Nya.GG domain, and now I&rsquo;m holding onto it like a domain goblin because good domains are worth gold. Because of how short the domain name is, I always wanted to use it as an easy image and link distribution platform, which I&rsquo;ve recently built using Java Spring.</p></p>

<p>Vanilla.sh is the website you&rsquo;re currently on. If you&rsquo;re reading this, that means it&rsquo;s live! It&rsquo;s meant to act as a general portfolio of my work. Do you think it&rsquo;s doing its job? The website was scaffolded in pure HTML and CSS and then migrated onto a Hugo theme in order to be able to easily alter its content.</p></p>
