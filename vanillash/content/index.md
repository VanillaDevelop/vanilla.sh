# About Me

I am a software developer from Innsbruck, Austria.

# Development

I consider myself an _engineer_ at heart. That generally means a lot of tinkering. Over the years I've played around with several dozen different programming language, frameworks, and libraries. I learned the basics, maybe built a small project with it, and then moved on. The problem with this approach is that you never really learn the intricacies of each tool fully, and spend a lot of time re-learning the same concepts with different accents. Recently, I've resolved myself to use a smaller toolkit.

As a huge fan of rapid prototyping and building clean and useful UIs for my applications, I've recently fallen in love with Flutter for building cross-platform frontend apps. In the future, I hope to pivot most of my frontend- and full-stack development to Dart and Flutter.

Let's be real: Java is probably not a favourite among coders. However, as I have a lot of exposition to Java EE for backend development in my current position, Spring is a natural fit for quickly bootstrapping APIs, and Java-based servers can generally be deployed relatively painlessly.

{{< feature-item title="Python" image="/images/Python-logo.png" >}}
I used Python excessively during my university days, especially during my master's programme, which was heavily focused on machine learning and data science. While I've since sworn off using Python for other use-cases like web-apps (Django ♥), I still use it for data analysis and machine learning projects.

{{< feature-item title="C / C# / C++" image="/images/C-logo.png" >}}
Although C# holds a special place in my heart for being the first programming language I learned, I tend not to come in contact with it very frequently. However, C-based languages are used in various places of interest, such as game development and microcontrollers.

Despite focusing on these languages, the world of software development is vast, and I won't always be able to resist the temptation to tinker with a new toy. For example, the website you're on right now was originally scaffolded using Bootstrap Studio using pure HTML and CSS, then converted into a Hugo template. Did I know what Hugo was before I built it? No, but after seeing that Squarespace charges 11€/month and doesn't even offer the option to change your template for all pages of a blog, I figured this was the better investment.
